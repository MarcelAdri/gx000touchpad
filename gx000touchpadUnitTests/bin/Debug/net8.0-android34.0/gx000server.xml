            Event that is triggered when a property value changes.

            <summary>
            The ProcessSimData class is responsible for processing simulated flight data. It listens for property changes
            in the GenerateFlightSimContent and processes them accordingly. The class implements the INotifyPropertyChanged
            interface to notify the UI of any updates to its properties.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            The class subscribes to property change events from the GenerateFlightSimContent and updates the CurrentVariable
            property based on the new values. It processes different data types such as StringType, IntType, and LongType
            to create appropriate Variable objects.
            </remarks>
            <example>
            ProcessSimData is instantiated by passing a GenerateFlightSimContent object to its constructor. The class listens
            for changes and processes them automatically.

            This method is responsible for cleaning up resources consumed by the ProcessSimData object.
            It invokes the Dispose method with disposing set to true to release managed resources and
            then calls SuppressFinalize to prevent finalization.
